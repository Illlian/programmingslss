Modules are pieces of code that we can borrow in python
This includes things like functions

>For example in random we use .choice() function 
>to choose something randomly from the [[lists]]

These pieces of code are **NOT** automatically included,
so we need to import them into our code explicidly

# Import
The import keyword loads the module into our file
**Import should be at the top of our file**

# The time module
Time allows us to play around with anything related to time
Specifically, we can use time to pause our code
eg
```python
import time

#Pause our code for a second
time.sleep(1)
```
