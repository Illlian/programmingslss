In python lists are a collection of items
We store values inside of lists
The values of the items can be of different [[Types]]
**Order matters** in a list

# Creating a list
To make a list, we use brackets \[\] to surround our list
We separate the individual items with commas
eg
```python
some_list = ["Jimmy", "Sara", "Frederique"]

```

# Access elements in the list
We can access the individual things in a list using bracket notation
Access eg:
```python
some_list[1]           #"Sara"
some_list[0]           #"Jimmy"  
some_list[-1].         #"Frederique", from the end
```
Inside the brackets, we give the *index* of the item we want
Python uses 0-index counting, which means we start counting at 0
