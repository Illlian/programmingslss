#   Output
We can display text and symbols using output 

We use a `print` function to display the output

```python
print()
```

# Comments
Comments are pieces of text that are NOT interpreted by python
This means that the text is **ignored**
We us hash symbols to make comments

# [[Headers]]

# Input
We grab the information from the user using ```input()

```python
input()
input("prompt")

```
