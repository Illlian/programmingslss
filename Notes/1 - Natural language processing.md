#   Output
We can display text and symbols using output 

We use a `print` function to display the output

```python
print()
```

# Comments
Comments are pieces of text that are NOT interpreted by python
This means that the text is **ignored**
We us hash symbols to make comments

# [[Headers]]

# Input
We grab the information from the user using ```input()
```python
input()
input("prompt")

```

# Variables
Variables allow us to store information for the time the app is running.

```python
Favourite food = input("What is your favourite food?")
```
Favourite food -.> name of the variable
= -> assignment operator
input... -> value

# [[Strings]]

# [[Design]]

# [[Lists]]

# [[Modules]]

# [[Conditionals]]

# [[Boolean]]
